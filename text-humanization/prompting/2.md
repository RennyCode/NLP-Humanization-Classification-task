PROMPT:
-------
let's implement this rules system in a python file.

the interface is:
```
python humanize_text --input "hello world"
```

the input is text, i want you to run all rules, write the score and  of each rule, fix the text of each rule, and write it as final output.  i want to see both the result of each rule and the final output after running all rules



rules:

Below is a list of 20 deterministic, rule‐based transformations (“rules”) designed to “humanize” LLM output. Each rule is described with its purpose, three concrete examples of its transformation, and pseudocode outlining both a fix (transformation) function and a score function (that returns a value between 0 and 1 based on how “AI-like” or “human-like” the text is along that dimension).
