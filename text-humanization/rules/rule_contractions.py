"""
Contraction Usage Rule

Purpose:  
Convert formal expressions into contractions (e.g., "do not" â†’ "don't") to create a friendlier, more casual tone.

Examples:  
- Example 1:  
  Input: "do not"  
  Output: "don't"
- Example 2:  
  Input: "cannot"  
  Output: "can't"
- Example 3:  
  Input: "I am"  
  Output: "I'm"
